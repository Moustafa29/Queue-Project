# Queue-Project
a data structure project , a task generator which generate tasks to 2 computers

i made a server consists of 2 computers.
  Tasks arrive at random intervals and attempt to use the available computer,
• If the computer is available, the task is immediately allowed to use it.
• Each task requires a certain amount of time (random number) and must wait for a certain random time.
• If the computer is currently being used, then an arriving task waits in a Queue until a computer becomes available.
• Assume that the task arrival time and service time follows exponential distribution. The average service time is 25 sec
 and the average interarrival time is 20 sec
